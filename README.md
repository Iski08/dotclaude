What DotClaude offers
DotClaude provides three core AI agents that work in concert to improve software quality and team effectiveness:

- Code Review Agent: Examines pull requests, diffs, and test results. It flags potential bugs, style deviations, anti-patterns, and maintainability concerns. It suggests concrete changes, explains the rationale, and helps enforce coding standards.
- Security Analysis Agent: Scans code, dependencies, and configurations for security risks. It identifies vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, weak defaults, and potential threat vectors. It proposes remediation steps and tracks the risk posture over time.
- Technical Leadership Agent: Translates technical signals into actionable guidance. It creates roadmaps, documents standards, generates meeting notes, and helps plan releases. It aligns team priorities with risk and quality goals.

All three agents are orchestrated by a lightweight conductor that handles task routing, caching, and auditing. The design emphasizes safety, repeatability, and clarity. You get repeatable outputs, with explanations that you can review and adjust.

How it works
DotClaude sits at the intersection of code, conversations, and policy. The workflow typically looks like this:

- Input: A repository, a pull request, or a codebase snapshot is fed into DotClaude.
- Orchestrator: A central controller splits input into tasks and assigns them to specialized agents. It caches frequent results to reduce latency.
- Agents: Each agent runs its analysis in a controlled context. They return findings, recommended changes, and risk scores.
- Synthesis: The conductor aggregates outputs, resolves conflicts, and presents a unified report. It also generates follow-up tasks and improvement plans.
- Output: The team receives clear, actionable guidance, plus optional doc pages, checklists, and meeting notes.

The system emphasizes explainability. Each recommendation includes the rationale, affected files, and a confidence score. You can adjust the prompts and policies to fit your project.

Elements you will interact with
- A lightweight CLI to start, run, and monitor DotClaude.
- A web-like interface for dashboards, summaries, and reports (CLI-driven UI is fully capable for headless setups).
- A policy layer that encodes team standards, security posture, and release criteria.
- A store of prompts, templates, and templates you can customize.
- An audit log capturing decisions, actions taken, and agent outputs.

Key configuration concepts
- API keys and credentials: The system uses API keys for AI services when needed. Store credentials securely using your platformâ€™s best practices.
- Policies and standards: You can define coding standards, security baselines, and leadership templates. The policy layer enforces these rules during analyses.
- Data handling: DotClaude reads only what you authorize. It logs actions for auditing but respects configured data retention rules.
- Model choices: Decide between cloud-based models or local/offline options. The conductor supports swapping models with minimal changes.

Operational best practices
- Start with a small scope: Begin with a single repository and a narrow policy set. Validate outputs and adjust prompts as needed.
- Iterate prompts: Fine-tune prompts to match your team language and conventions. Save templates for reuse.
- Combine outputs: Use code review results, security findings, and leadership notes together to form a holistic plan.
- Maintain policy discipline: Keep your standards up to date. Regularly review and refine policies to reflect evolving coding practices and security guidance.
- Protect sensitive data: Ensure secrets and private configuration remain out of code reviews. Use environment-based configuration and secret managers.

Using the CLI and prompts
DotClaude exposes a concise CLI with subcommands for the main tasks. You can extend prompts or swap them out in the prompts directory. The prompts drive how each agent reasons about the data.

Examples of prompts you may encounter
- Code Review Prompt: It focuses on readability, correctness, performance, and maintainability. It asks for examples, references, and suggested edits.
- Security Analysis Prompt: It looks for known vulnerabilities, dependency issues, and insecure configurations. It asks for impact estimates and recommended mitigations.
- Leadership Prompt: It outlines a path for delivering features, aligning with roadmap goals, and communicating decisions to the team.

Prompt customization
- You can supply custom prompt files for each agent. Place new prompts in the prompts folder and reference them in your configuration.
- The system validates prompts to prevent harmful instructions and to maintain a predictable behavior pattern.
- Prompts can include placeholders for project-specific data, such as repository names, branch names, and policy IDs.

Prompts and behavior guidelines
- Clarity first: Prompts aim for concise, actionable output. They emphasize specific file paths, line numbers, and recommended edits.
- Safety checks: Agents raise flags for risky changes and require human review for critical decisions.
- Consistency: Prompts encourage consistent formatting in outputs, such as standardized PR summaries and security reports.
- Traceability: Each output includes rationale, confidence, and references to relevant files or sections.

Data, privacy, and security
- Data scope: DotClaude processes code, metadata about changes, and configuration data needed to perform analyses.
- Privacy: You control the scope of analysis and the data that the system can access. Secrets never appear in generated reports without explicit redaction.
- Security posture: The system is designed to minimize exposure. It logs activities for audit and compliance but respects your retention policies.
- Compliance: If you require compliance with internal standards, you can tailor the policy layer to enforce those standards across analyses.

Architecture and data flow
- Orchestrator (Conductor): Routes tasks to specialized agents, caches results, and manages context. It ensures outputs are coherent and traceable.
- Code Review Agent: Analyzes diffs, tests, and file contents. Produces change suggestions with annotated diffs where needed.
- Security Analysis Agent: Scans dependencies, configuration, and code for vulnerabilities. Produces risk scores and remediation steps.
- Technical Leadership Agent: Creates planning documents, project roadmaps, and leadership-facing outputs.
- Data stores: A lightweight vector store for code search, a log store for audits, and a policy store for standards.
- Interfaces: A CLI and optional web UI allow both headless and interactive use.
